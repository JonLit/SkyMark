# SkyMark
a cross-platform, openGL (Processing P2D) "Benchmark"

# How it Works
SkyMark draws a random point on the x-Axis, for each vertical line of pixels.
In v0.1 and v0.2 it does it three times.

# Score
The Score is the time in ms, that the program needed to calculate and draw the dots.


!!IMPORTANT!!

  The Score is only partially compatible through versions
  for Example:
  
  Score of v0.1 and v0.2 ARE NOT compatible
  Score of v0.1.x and another v0.1.x ARE compatible
